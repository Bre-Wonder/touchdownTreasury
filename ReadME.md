# Tounchdown Treasury App

Status: IN PROGRESS

### Project Description:

  This project was developed for a client who hosts a football team pool, The Touchdown Treasury, each NFL season. The client wanted a single-page application featuring three main sections: Team Draft Selections, Scoreboard, and Playoff Bracket.

  The goal of this application was to create an online version of the scores the client previously managed in Excel.

  Draft Page: Allows users to select an NFL team to join their roster for the season.

  Scoreboard: Tracks weekly wins and automatically updates standings after each calendar day there is a football game to display the current leader.

  Playoff Bracket: Displays playoff matchups, records the results of each game, and tracks the prize money won by each participant.

  This application provides an engaging and streamlined way for users to manage and track their fantasy football season online.
